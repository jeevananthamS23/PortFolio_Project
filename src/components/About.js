              I am a motivated and curious Computer Science enthusiast pursuing B.Tech in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science (2023â€“2027) at Sri Eshwar College of Engineering. With a strong foundation in C, C++, Python, Java, and JavaScript, I enjoy full-stack development and exploring core CS concepts like Data Structures, OOPS, and DBMS.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have hands-on experience with modern web technologies such as React.js, Node.js, Express.js, Next.js, and MongoDB, and I love working on projects that combine creativity with problem-solving.
            </p>
            <p>
              Beyond academics, I actively practice problem-solving on platforms like LeetCode, CodeChef, and HackerRank, having solved 2000+ coding problems overall.
